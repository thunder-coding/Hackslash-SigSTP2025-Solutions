Task 2 - Task Manager with Priority Scheduling

Problem Description:
Design and implement a Task Manager that manages tasks based on priority. Each task has a unique ID, a description, and a priority level. Tasks with the highest priority (lowest priority number) are processed first.

Objectives:
 Efficient Task Scheduling: Ensure tasks execute based on priority.
 Dynamic Task Management: Supporttask addition,removal by Id, display, and retrieval ofthe highest priority task.
 Optimal Performance: Utilize an appropriate data structure to minimize
computational overhead.

Implementation Requirements:
 Add a Task: Assigns an ID, description, and priority.
 Remove a Task: Removes a specific tas by the given Id
 Display All Tasks: Lists all tasks sorted by priority.
 Retrieve the Highest Priority Task: Returns the task with the lowest priority number.
