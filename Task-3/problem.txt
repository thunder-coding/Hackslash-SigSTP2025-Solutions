Task 3 - The Trial ofthe Cheater’s Path

Problem Description:
You are accused of cheating in a HackSlash induction task. To prove your innocence, you must navigate the Path of Truth, a maze-like challenge requiring you to follow left/right instructions to move from AAA to ZZZ.
Part 1:
 Start at node AAA and follow the given left/right instructions repeatedly until you reach ZZZ.
 The maze consists of nodes connected by left and right paths.
 Calculate the number of steps required to reach ZZZ.

Part 2:
 Instead of starting at a single node, begin at all nodes ending with 'A'.
 Follow all possible paths simultaneously.
 The goal is to make all paths reach nodes ending in 'Z' at the same time.
 Compute the number of steps required for all paths to complete simultaneously.
